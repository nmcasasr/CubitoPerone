//HOW TO USE THIS ASSET//
/////////////////////////

Hello! Thank you for downloading the Super Pixel Dungeon Tileset. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

- In the root folder, you will find four style folders. These folders correspond to each tileset color style.

- In the style folders, you will find a folder named PNG. This folder contains all the objects and tiles as descriptively-named PNGs.

- In the style folders, you will also find a folder named spritesheet. This folder contains the spritesheet, and two choices of metadata format for reading the spritesheet. (Pick the format you like!)

- You can help make sense of the labels using the following guide, which applies to all my tilesets.

File name definitions:
	- "terrain"				Part of the tileset's terrain. The player probably stands on this.

	- "left/right/top/bottom"		The left/right/top/bottom wall or edge of the terrain.

	- "bg1", "bg2", etc.			Background. Higher number indicates further back.

	- "fg1", "fg2", etc.			Foreground. Higher number indicates further forwards.

	- "_A", "_B", "_C", etc.		A suffix with a letter indicates there are multiple variants of this object.

	- "frame0000", "frame0001", etc.	Filenames like this indicate an animation.
	  or "f0", "f1", etc.

	- "2x2", "4x4", etc.			Indicates the size of this object, in tiles.

- Pretty much every object and tile is a size multiple of 16x16 pixels. They're made to stick to an 8x8 or 16x16 grid, but you don't necessarily have to stick to a grid if you don't want to.

- Be sure to check out the included example images to see how to put the tileset together.

Any questions?
Email me at contact@untiedgames.com and I'll try to answer as best I can!
